This third edition of JavaScript: The Definitive Guide describes the
latest version of the language, JavaScript 1.2, as supported by
Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 4. The book also covers
JavaScript 1.1, which is the first industry-standard version known as
ECMAScript. The new features of JavaScript 1.2, which are likely to be
embodied in a later ECMAScript standard release, are clearly
indicated, so that you can use them as appropriate in your scripts.
