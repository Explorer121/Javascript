When users take one look at a Web site and click away, never to return,
often it's because the site is the unfortunate result of multimedia turned
media frenzy. A million new users plug into the Web each month, and
capturing a loyal audience for your site requires that you achieve the
ideal balance between content and style. In Creating Dynamic Web
Sites, Scott Fisher demonstrates how to master this balancing act.
Fisher's innovative approach first considers the audience -- the human
being on the other side of the screen -- before he guides you through
the bewildering array of technical and design issues that confront every
Webmaster. An understanding of the psychology of user interaction
enables you to plan graphics-intensive, highly interactive Web pages
that are right for your audience and for your product or service.
