This book is a potpourri of everything you need to know for designing Web
pages. It provides quick access to the wide range of front-end
technologies and techniques from which Web designers and authors must
draw. It is an excellent reference to HTML 4.0, with special attention given
to browser support and platform idiosyncrasies. The HTML section is more
than a reference work: it gives ideas and workarounds for using tables and
frames on your site. The book also covers multimedia and interactivity,
audio and video, Cascading Style Sheets, and emerging technologies like
Dynamic HTML, XML, embedded fonts, and internationalization.
