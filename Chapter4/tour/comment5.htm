Everyone bow down and pay homage to this magnificent piece of text.
Written by Larry Wall (the creator of Perl), Tom Christiansen (a Perl
guru), and Randall Schwartz (the author of Learning Perl), this book
contains a thorough reference to every possible thing you might ever
want to do in the language. If you are serious about programming in this
language, there should be a copy of this book on your desk somewhere.
